We  hunger  to  understand, so we invent
myths  about how we imagine the world is
constructed  -  and  they're, of course,
based   upon  what  we  know,  which  is
ourselves  and other animals. So we make
up  stories  about  how  the  world  was
hatched  from  a  cosmic  egg or created
after the mating of cosmic deities or by
some   fiat   of   a   powerful   being.
We  have  also  arranged  things so that
almost  no  one  understands science and
technology.  This  is a prescription for
disaster.  We might get away with it for
a   while,  but  sooner  or  later  this
combustible  mixture  of  ignorance  and
power  is going to blow up in our faces.
